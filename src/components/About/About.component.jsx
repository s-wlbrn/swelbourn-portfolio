        <p>
          I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on front-end development,
          currently based in Nashville, TN. Working as a professional violin and
          bass player has given me an appreciation for working as a team with
          talented people. I'm currently diving into the world of web
          development with a mindset of curiosity and continual growth.
