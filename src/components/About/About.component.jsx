        <p>
          I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on front-end development,
          currently based in Nashville, TN. As a developer and a musician, I
          have a great appreciation for working as a team with talented people.
          I strive to use modular and performant code to create apps that make
          people happy, while maintaining a mindset of curoiosity and continual
          growth.
